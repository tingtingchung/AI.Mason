**Module 6: Team Projects & Final Exam**

**TP3 Team Project instructions**  
At the end of the semester, each team will complete a case study and give a 15-min presentation.
The case study should be about one or more business applications of AI that we may or may not have covered in class.
The content of the presentation must go above and beyond what has been presented in the course already.
For example, if you present a recommender system, explore and explain aspects of recommenders that we have not studied already.
Be as specific as you can when defining the scope of your case study.  
The presentation should include  
1. [2 min] Problem statement - What problem are you trying to solve in this case study? And how is it relevant to what's being discussed this week?  
2. [5 min] Discussion of at least 1 relevant research paper (not news articles, medium, blog, library documentation, or linkedin posts) that is high quality, less than 3 years old, and from one of research sources listed below.
3. [5 min] A technical coding demo whenever possible: Build, train and evaluate a model as much as you can. Keep the coding demo as simple as possible to illustrate an essential concept rather than walking through a complete project. You can demo code examples found on the internet, but you must cite the source. If coding demo is not possible, demo different ways to use an AI application (e.g., ChatGPT) for a business problem.  
4. [2 min] Discussion of ethical concerns.  
5. [1 min] What's next? Help us envision future developments and concerns.    
*Note: Time estimates are suggestions only. Do what you need to do to deliver an engaging and compelling story!

**1. Problem Statement (15%):** Clear, concise, accurate and focused statement of the problem being solved.  
**2. Research Paper Discussion (30%):** Clear, accurate and thoughtful critiques of relevant high-quality technical paper(s) (not just case studies) that focus on key concepts, strengths or weaknesses.   
**3. Technical Demo (35%):** Thoughtful and comprehensive solution that addresses the problem statement in a logical manner and issues identified in the critiques. Proper data processing and exploration and clear rationale for algorithm choices.  
**4. Ethical Discussion (5%):** Focused and thoughtful exploration of key ethical issues in your chosen topic.
